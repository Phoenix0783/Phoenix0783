## Hi there! Nice to see you here. 👋

I am Ajay, a mobile app developer, and I am also working as a content writer at OtakuKart. I like to develop mobile apps with Flutter and Dart and also love to explore new ideas, errors, and technologies. If you ever need an app, let's make one together.

I also love to design new trending mobile app designs with the help of Figma and Photoshop, from zero to a well-designed app. I would love to collaborate with you and work on some new ideas.
